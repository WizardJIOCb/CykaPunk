Started to play Cyberpunk 2077 and it has been a great source of inspiration to start somewhere for my sci-fi inspired UI or component library. It is based off of the in-game menu and is a take of what a Slack or Discord app could look like with a sci-fi look and feel.

That and also those days between Christmas and new year's eve are a blakhole, especially when there's a storm for 3-4 days straight in Paris, FR. So here's how I kept myself busy back at my family's place.

I can see that pen evolve into a fully-fledge UI kit or component library. Wyh not. At least, it could be a start for a fun for something like a design system but sci-fi-esque... or an attempt of one... Until the next side project comes knocking.
